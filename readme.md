#Medicinpriser - Code challenge#

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a simple game of **Tic-tac-toe**. The game should be 
structured using Angular controllers and views. This starter pack contains a basic Angular application structur with an empty
starting view. The game should - at a minimum - be able to handle state and the high score of who is winning. It is not nessesary to implement a computer to play against, a 2 player game in the browser is fine. You can spend as much or little time as you feel is necessary, but **no more than 5 hours**. It is okay to submit a non-finished project as long as the base functionality is there.

##Prerequisites##
* Node ^5.5.0
* Bower
* Gulp

##How to get started##

* Install bower dependencies ```$ bower install```

this in anyway you see fit :)

##What is included in this project##
* Angular 1.5
* Angular UI Router
* Twitter bootstrap
* SASS to CSS compile task

##How to submit##
* If you forked this project just push your changes and send an email with the url to your public fork or make sure to 
invite us so we can view your private project. **Alternatively**, send your project **without** node or bower dependencies as a zipped file to emil@medicinpriser.se

##What happens next##
We'll take a few days to look through your code. After that, we will arrange for a second interview, where we will go through the code with you to learn more about the decisions you made and why. For this second interview, make sure you're prepared to answer questions about your code.

##Troubleshooting##

`Local gulp not found in ...`
Make sure you run npm install

`npm WARN deprecated`
If you get some warnings when installing npm packages you can ignore these for now
